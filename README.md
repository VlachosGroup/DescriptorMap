Descriptor-Based Microkinetic Analyais Package (DescMAP) =============

The **Desc**riptor-Based **M**icrokinetic **A**nalysis **P**ackage
(DescMAP) is a Python library developed by the Vlachos Research Group at
the University of Delaware. This code was developed to automate feature
selection and volcano curve generation for heterogeneous catalysis using
empirical and semi-empirical approaches coupled with microkinetic
modeling. Inputting data via spreadsheets and controlling program
behavior via template files increases flexibility and supported
capabilities.
