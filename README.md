# Descriptor-Based Microkinetic Analyais Package (DescMAP)

The **Desc**riptor-Based **M**icrokinetic **A**nalysis **P**ackage
(DescMAP) is a Python library developed by the Vlachos Research Group at
the University of Delaware. This code was developed to automate descriptor
selection and volcano curve generation for heterogeneous catalysis using
empirical and semi-empirical approaches coupled with microkinetic
modeling. Both electronic and geometric descriptors are supported.
Inputting data via spreadsheets and controlling program
behavior via template files increases flexibility and supported
capabilities.
