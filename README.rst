Descriptor-Based Microkinetic Analysis Package (DescMAP)
========================================================

The **Desc**\ riptor-Based **M**\ icrokinetic **A**\ nalysis
**P**\ ackage (DescMAP) is a Python library developed by the Vlachos
Research Group at the University of Delaware. This code was developed to
automate descriptor selection and volcano curve generation for
heterogeneous catalysis using empirical and semi-empirical approaches
coupled with microkinetic modeling. Both electronic and geometric
descriptors are supported. Inputting data via spreadsheets and
controlling program behavior via template files increases flexibility
and supported capabilities.
